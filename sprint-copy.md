## Who Would Benefit From This Sprint

### Personas (3-column layout, condensed)

**Persona 1: The Corporate Dreamer**
> Stable job, but Sunday nights you feel the pull. You want to test an idea without quitting anything—a low-risk experiment to see if it has legs.

**Persona 2: The Small Business Owner**
> You already run something but want to try new things. A group to bounce ideas off and some structure to actually ship something new.

**Persona 3: The "Someday" Experimenter**
> You've been meaning to start for a while. What if the right time is just picking a small idea and trying it with others doing the same?

### Why Now (centered below personas)

**Title:** The Right Moment Is Now

**Body:**
> **Here's what changed: AI.** Building a business no longer requires skills you don't have. This sprint isn't a course—it's a group of builders doing it together. I'm building too. In 10 working days, we go from "I've been meaning to..." to "It's live." Because we're doing it together.

## Tone Guidelines

When editing copy, maintain these principles:

1. **Direct and honest** - No fluff, no corporate speak
2. **Action-oriented** - Focus on doing, not learning
3. **Humble** - You're a fellow builder, not an expert above the reader
4. **Inviting** - Make it feel like joining friends, not enrolling in a program
5. **Human** - Write like you talk, not like a brochure
6. **Experimental** - Emphasize low-risk experimentation over big commitments

### What to Avoid
- Preachy language ("The truth is...", "You don't need permission...")
- Positioning yourself as an expert above the audience
- Corporate/marketing speak ("Fortune 500 frameworks", "comprehensive curriculum")
- Guilt or pressure tactics ("Stop waiting", "The perfect moment is a myth")
