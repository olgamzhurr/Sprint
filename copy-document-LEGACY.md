## Pain Points Section

**Headline:**
> You Have Ideas. What You Need Is Action.

### Pain Point 1
**Title:** "I have too many ideas"
**Body:** You start excited, then get overwhelmed. Nothing gets finished. You jump from idea to idea, never committing long enough to see results.

### Pain Point 2
**Title:** "I work alone"
**Body:** No one to push you forward. No one to review your work. No one to celebrate wins with-or pick you up when things get hard.

### Pain Point 3
**Title:** "I don't know where to start"
**Body:** Business plans, MVPs, marketing, legal stuff... it all feels too big. So you keep researching instead of doing.

**Transition Line:**
> You don't need another course. You need momentum, structure, and a community building alongside you.

## FAQ Section

**Headline:**
> Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: What if I don't have a clear idea yet?
**A:** Perfect. Day 1 is specifically about discovering and validating ideas. Many participants start with nothing more than "I want to build something" and leave with a launched business. The process helps you focus.

### Q2: How much time do I need?
**A:** Plan for 2-3 hours per day for the live sprint sessions, plus some independent work time. It's intensive by design-that's how we create momentum. If you're doing the self-paced workbook, you control your schedule.

### Q3: What if I can't make all the live sessions?
**A:** Sessions are recorded and shared with participants. But honestly? The magic is in doing it live together. The accountability, real-time feedback, and energy of the group are hard to replicate async.

### Q4: Is this for digital or physical products?
**A:** Both. The framework works for apps, SaaS, services, physical products, and more. We've had participants launch everything from coaching businesses to e-commerce stores to software products.

### Q5: What happens after the 10 days?
**A:** You'll have a launched business-that's the goal. But you'll also join our alumni community where past participants support each other, share wins, and continue building together.

## Tone Guidelines

When editing copy, maintain these principles:

1. **Direct and bold** - No fluff, no corporate speak
2. **Action-oriented** - Focus on doing, not learning
3. **Empathetic** - Acknowledge the struggle without being patronizing
4. **Confident** - You know this works
5. **Human** - Write like you talk, not like a brochure
